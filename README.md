# MeteorDoctor - Let's Detect Meteors!
This is an extension to my signal classification project as defined in the report contained in the folder below:
- https://goo.gl/PK8S3v

Operation is very similar to the repo here:
- https://github.com/m0zjo-code/signaldoctor-zmqserver

Currently only reading from *.wav recordings is possible but in the future, live audio from either a conventional radio, online sources or from a RTL-SDR will be supported.
